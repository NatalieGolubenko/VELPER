# VELPER
An innovative P2P Uber-mode Blockchain platform created to operating system created to allow people receiving instant video-consultations on any issue online. 

The developers of VELPER.io claim that it will have many benefits for anyone who used to solve problems quickly
You just need to have a smartphone with Internet-connection to join the global VELPER system and get a video consultation from a specialist on any issue, or vice versa - to become an assistant and earn money at a convenient time, regardless of the time of the day and actual location.

Working mechanism: an authorized user enters a description of his problem in a special field or selects it from the automatically offered tags, and the application finds an appropriate assistant from all over the world who speaks the chosen language and is competent enough at a chosen field to give a professional advice. 


Automatic selection of the assistant is carried out thanks to the patented technology. At first, the candidate goes through secure online testing (in each category there are a number of control questions). If the test was passed successfully, the employee of the company communicates with the applicant to assess his sociability and politeness. The candidate becomes an assistant and can receive orders only after a double check. Number of assistants who can work in the application isn’t limited, but each of them should undergo a rigorous selection. The project also has a social mission, since it allows to work and earn people who become disabled, but still remain high-class specialists. 

The choice of an assistant is based only on his professional experience, the number of successful consultations, as well as his personal rating. Consultations are paid per minute and the price isn’t that high, ‘cause VELPER allows you to solve your problem in a few minutes without calling a specialist home, that is much more expensive and takes a lot of time.

Payments inside the system are made exclusively by VLP tokens. Application enables users to buy these tokens in two clicks for several types of cryptocurrency, fiat money, e-money or credit card.
Smart contract charges a fixed per-minute fee for the provided online-consultation from the user's account and pays compensation to the assistant in accordance to the current tariff plan including the company commission. User can purchase additional options for VLP tokens, use cash back and award the performer inside the system. Tokens participate in referral and bounty programs. VLP tokens are also used by corporate clients and advertisers.

Advantages of using Blockchain technology. This technology allows to make the platform transparent, open and safe for all parties, as well as to resolve the issue of arbitration if the service, according to the Customer’s opinion, wasn’t rendered. Any client can receive a refund for a poorly provided service upon the decision of the arbitration court within 3 days. This condition is included in each smart contract, and the money will be returned in cryptocurrency at the current exchange rate (via cryptocurrency exchange platform). 


So, at the end of this article we want to say, that the mission of this project is to make our lives more efficient.  Probably, VELPER is able not only to define the future of big data and Internet of things, but also become a new generation of UBER.
